## How to contribute

For people that don't know git, Github's [learn git in 15 minutes](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) tutorial is extremely helpful. However, knowing git is not a requirement for contributing. The easiest way to contribute is by creating an issue through Github and discussing changes. These changes could be as small as a spelling mistake or it could be about a larger issue like content. The other main way to contribute will be through pull requests. Pull requests will require some knowledge of git.

Issues will be used for discussion of content, changes to the overall plan, and they will be used by people to reccomend any changes if they don't know git.

Actual changes to content will be done through forks and pull requests.

Look for anything contained in curly braces as this is a meta-comment on what should go in that particular place.

Ideally save grammar and spelling changes for bigger sweeps of entire sections. Make note of them as an issue.

## Dev Phase

We are currently in the brainstorming / basic framework phase so nothing is final and ideas have yet to be consolidated. Everything is up for discussion, even the overall structure of the document.

During the early phases when the content is volatile, we'll use markdown files for the basic structure of the document (headers, text, links, etc...). Later during the polish phase, it may be beneficial to switch to LaTex for a more robust formatting.

## Notes

This is an experiment to test the Git workflow with official document creation. Meta discussions are also welcome to improve the workflow of document creation and editing. Document creation is not the original intent of git and this project may run into problems with the way git handles diffs.
